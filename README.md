# Healthcare-Portal
With this project, a comprehensive healthcare portal with an easy-to-use user interface and illness prediction modules has been created based on machine learning. Three crucial modules—diabetes prediction, symptoms-based disease prediction, and heart disease prediction—were painstakingly implemented and integrated at the outset of the project. These modules use sophisticated machine learning techniques like ensemble learning and decision trees to generate precise predictions for certain medical diseases. Our comprehensive validation and assessment procedures have shown the effectiveness and dependability of our prediction algorithms in precisely detecting possible health hazards. 
The creation of an interactive Python application that allows users to enter their medical data and get immediate forecasts is a crucial component of the project. By utilizing Streamlit integration, the application provides a smooth and user-friendly interface that enables users to make knowledgeable decisions regarding their health and overall wellbeing. People may use this interface to receive personalized illness forecasts, which can help in early diagnosis and proactive treatment of medical disorders.
